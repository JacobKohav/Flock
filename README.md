# Simulation of Flocks




Illustration of swarm intelligence through a flocking example utilizing coherent emergent behavior (focking) of a swarm, when each agent is

    1. attracted to other agents
    2. Repulsed when too close to other agents
    3. Performing velocity alignment with other agents

Examination of this behavior in 2D; the swarm will be composed of N agents; each agent will be defined by its position (p) and velocity (v).
