# Flock


Illustration of swarm intelligence through a flocking example utilizing coherent emergent behavior (focking) of a swarm, when each agent is 
1. attracted to other agents
2. repulsed when too close to other agents
3. performing velocity alignment with other agents 

Examination of this behavior in 2D; the swarm will be composed of N agents; each agent will be defined by its position (p) and velocity (v).
